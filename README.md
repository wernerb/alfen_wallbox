# Alfen Wallbox - HomeAssistant Integration

This is a custom component to allow control of Alfen Wallboxes in [HomeAssistant](https://home-assistant.io).

The component is a fork of the [Garo Wallbox custom integration](https://github.com/sockless-coding/garo_wallbox).

> After reverse engineering the API myself I found out that there is already a python libary wrapping the Alfen API.
